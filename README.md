- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @walker861
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently in healthcare but interested in self paced learning. I have no formal computer science background. 
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently using The Odin Project and a couple iOS apps (Mimo & Grasshopper) to learn web development. I hope to find other strategies for self paced learning for programming. I have dabbled with code in Ubuntu and Raspberry pi. I am looking to gain more familiarity with these platforms and possibly transition careers in the future if I continue to find enjoyment from it.
